# Microsoft Mesh Toolkit Sample: Mesh 101

![Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 Sphere Terraces](docs/Mesh101.png)

## What is Mesh 101?

The *Mesh 101* tutorial project is created for intermediate to advanced Unity developers with an introduction to the fundamental Mesh Toolkit building blocks thus enabling them to hone their skills and eventually create delightful experiences with our Mesh Toolkit in Unity. In the Mesh 101 tutorial project, we demonstrate building shared immersive environments and experiences in Mesh using an interactive learning experience about wind turbines. The tutorial gives a holistic introduction to the power of Mesh, spanning Mesh Physics, Mesh Scripting, and more.

In this project, you'll find 2 Scenes:

* **FinishedProject.unity**: This scene contains a completed version of the tutorial.
* **StartingPoint.unity**: It contains a pre-built scene where Mesh features can be added by following the tutorial.

In this tutorial, you'll complete a series of tasks that use Mesh Visual Scripting and Mesh Physics to create an experience that can be uploaded and used in Mesh.

* Chapter 1: Overview and setup
* Chapter 2: Prepare the tutorial project
* Chapter 3: Add interactivity with Mesh Visual Scripting
  * Station 3.1: Create an Interactable Button
  * Station 3.2: Trigger an info dialog
  * Station 3.3: Teleport to the turbine generator
* Chapter 4: Move objects and trigger animations with Mesh Physics
  * Station 4.1: Grab and Release objects
  * Station: 4.2 Animation Trigger
  * Station 4.3: Constraining Bodies
* Chapter 5: Make your Environment available for Events
* Chapter 6: Create an Event and invite others

Developers start with a pre-built Unity project, where they can add custom interactivity and other Mesh features, and then deploy the project as an Environment to Microsoft Mesh.
