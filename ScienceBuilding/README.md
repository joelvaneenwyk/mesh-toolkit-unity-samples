## What is ScienceBuilding?

The *ScienceBuilding* project (scene: ScienceBuilding) demonstrates the use of a wide variety of Mesh.Physics features within the Microsoft Mesh Toolkit for the creation of custom experiences.

In this project, you'll find:

* **The Rambunctious Machine**: demonstrating interactive physics constrained to 2D
* **Wave and Frequency**: ~100 connected physics bodies moving in mesmerizing beauty
* **Gravity Simulator**: switching between earth, moon and space
* **Mass and Gravity**: planets and other objects orbiting around the sun
* **Buoyancy and Balance**: ships or other objects floating on the waves
* **Gone Fishin'!**: catch fish, ships or a penguin with a magnetic fishing rod

On the gallery there a many more exhibits:

* **Magnetism**, **Bowling**, **Air Hockey**, **Balance Scales**, **Black Holes** and the **Marble Race**

This is a carefully designed scene that demonstrates the power of combining appealing visuals with the creative use of Mesh Physics features. Feel free to inspect, modify and play with the scene or use elements to creatively enhance your own custom experiences!
