![MeshWebSlate Terraces Showcasing the Earth prefab](README/Mesh201.png)

## What is Mesh 201?

The *Mesh 201* tutorial project is created for intermediate to advanced Unity developers with an introduction to the fundamental Mesh Toolkit building blocks thus enabling them to hone their skills and eventually create delightful experiences with our Mesh Toolkit in Unity. In the Mesh 201 tutorial project, we demonstrate building shared immersive environments and experiences in Mesh using Mesh WebSlates and Mesh Visual Scripting.

Developers start with a pre-built Unity project, where they can complete a series of tasks to add custom interactivity and other Mesh features, and then deploy the project as an Environment to Microsoft Mesh. The project has 2 Scenes:

* **FinishedProject.unity**: This scene contains a completed version of the tutorial.
* **StartingPoint.unity**: It contains a pre-built scene where Mesh features can be added by following the tutorial.

## How to use

* Follow the Mesh 201 Tutorial Docs for a guided walkthrough
